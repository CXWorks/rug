//! Generating UUIDs from timestamps.
//!
//! Timestamps are used in a few UUID versions as a source of decentralized
//! uniqueness (as in versions 1 and 6), and as a way to enable sorting (as
//! in versions 6 and 7). Timestamps aren't encoded the same way by all UUID
//! versions so this module provides a single [`Timestamp`] type that can
//! convert between them.
//!
//! # Timestamp representations in UUIDs
//!
//! Versions 1 and 6 UUIDs use a bespoke timestamp that consists of the
//! number of 100ns ticks since `1582-10-15 00:00:00`, along with
//! a counter value to avoid duplicates.
//!
//! Version 7 UUIDs use a more standard timestamp that consists of the
//! number of millisecond ticks since the Unix epoch (`1970-01-01 00:00:00`).
//!
